# Connect Four Neural Net

This application is a clone of a tutorial project, which can be found at https://github.com/fcarsten/tic-tac-toe. The original project was designed to compare different types of nueral nets for playing the game tic-tac-toe. This project builds upon one of those models to play a game of Connect Four.
